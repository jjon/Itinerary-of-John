						The timeline above displays the itinerary of <span class="ttip">King John of England</span> for nearly every day of his seventeen year reign. Like most medieval kings, John's government was relentlessly itinerant. The places John visited are plotted on the map, changing dynamically, reflecting the places displayed in the lower band of the timeline. The timeline can be scrolled left and right by clicking and dragging, and you can observe John's progress as he traveled throughout England, Wales, Ireland, and France. The top band displays contextual events of general interest for the period, and the highlighted bar in the middle of the band represents the period of time displayed in the lower band.
						
						<p>The data displayed in this timeline was published in tabular format in the <cite>Rotuli Litterarum Patentium in Turri Londinensi Asservati</cite>, edited by Thomas Duffus Hardy, and published in 1835. This essential source for students of the period is a large folio volume not widely available and rather awkward to use. Both the itinerary and the text of the patent rolls themselves are presented here in a more convenient form as a service to historians and students.</p>
						
						<p>For a more detailed description of the structural elements of the timeline above, consult the information under the 'Legend' tab.</p>

							<li>Oct. 2017 &mdash; another remodel to present a goldmine of useful data generously provided by Janet Gillespie. In the course of her dissertation research, Gillespie has patiently and precisely investigated ALL of the sites mentioned in Hardy's Itinerary of John, assembled geographical coordinates and source material on all except one location, and commented on the importance of each in the context of John's itinerations.<p>As mentioned below, the first generation of map coordinates for this site were the result of a very crude geocoding automation. Gillespie's data are far more complete and accurate and henceforth they will constitute the 'canonical' gazetteer for this site.</p><p>I'm very much indebted to Janet for her generous contribution and ongoing collaboration in this project.</p></li>

					<dt>The Patent Rolls</dt>
					<dd>
			
						The letters patent of the English crown are a foundational source for the study of medieval English government. These letters, "patent" because they were transmitted open and intended for all to see, constitute the primary instruments of royal government in the time of King John and his successors. They are the essential starting point for any study of medieval England, and indeed medieval Europe.
						
						<p>Letters patent from the medieval period touch upon every conceivable aspect of royal government, from treaties and diplomatic correspondence to fiscal matters and family politics. The best introduction to the patent rolls, their content and historical utility, is Hardy's own <a class="text-link" href="#" onclick="loadPage('-074'); return false">introduction</a> beginning on page i.</p>
						
						<p>The text of the <cite>Rot. Lit. Pat</cite> can be used independently from the timeline. Clicking on the 'Page Images' will display the text with a paging mechanism allowing you to consult the indexes of names and places, and go directly to pages of the introduction or the roll itself.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Record Type</dt>
					<dd>
						<img src="Images/record_type_example.png" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px" alt="example of record type" />
						When Hardy published the <cite>Rot. Lit. Pat.</cite> in 1835, it was thought that in order to preserve potential ambiguities present in the rolls, an effort should be made to reproduce the text including the system of scribal abbreviation in use during the thirteenth century. To that end, a typeface called "record type" was used, and an example drawn from the text is shown here. In practice, record type tends to obfuscate rather than illuminate. And for our purposes here, this specialized typeface has the added unfortunate effect of rendering the text opaque to ordinary OCR techniques. That is why the text of the rolls is not digitized and indexed as it should be. To improve the readability of the abbreviations, the aspect ratio of the page images for the body of the text has been slightly altered, elongating the images somewhat.
						
						<p>Record type takes some getting used to, but the Latin of the rolls is so highly formulaic that reading it is not too challenging. Fortunately, an excellent guide to the system of abbreviation is available: Martin, Charles Trice. <cite>The Record Interpreter: A Collection of Abbreviations, Latin Words and Names Used in English Historical Manuscripts and Records.</cite> London: Stevens and Sons, 1949. This work is still in print, has been through many editions, and is readily, and inexpensively available.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>The Itinerary</dt>
					<dd>
						The publication of the patent rolls alone was a boon to historians of medieval England, but Thomas Hardy went further. For the 1835 edition, Hardy collated information from the <i>teste</i> and dating clauses of the patent letters themselves with information drawn from the charter and close rolls, the wardrobe accounts, and the <i>praestita</i> rolls. Based on this collation, Hardy was able to determine the exact itinerary of the king for 4,390 of the 6356 days of his reign of his reign (69%). This was a remarkable feat of scholarship, and Hardy's itinerary has been an invaluable resource for historians ever since. (The pages of Hardy's original itinerary tables begin <a class="text-link" href="#" onclick="loadPage('-026'); return false">here</a>.)
						
						<p>Included below Hardy's tables was a gazetteer of the places mentioned, with the dates for each place listed. The data displayed in this timeline and map was captured by scanning the gazetteer, processing the image with OCR software, and parsing the result with a python script to produce a JavaScript object for the timeline software.</p>
						
						<p>Unfortunately, the <cite>Rot. Lit. Pat.</cite> is a fairly uncommon volume, available only in extensive research libraries. The purpose of this site is to offer the data of Hardy's itinerary in a more convenient and widely accessible format, and link it more closely with the patent letters themselves. Clicking on any of the events in the lower band of the timeline above will bring up an information bubble which contains links to the pages of the <cite>Rot. Lit. Pat</cite> that contain dated letters for the relevant period. Because the data in the itinerary was drawn from a variety of sources, not all of the events on the timeline will have links, and not all of the events will be represented in the patent letters at all. The timeline information bubbles also contain a straightforward great circle calculation of the distance from the previous itinerary location.</p>
						
						<p><span style="font-size: 120%; color: #FF9500">October, 2017:</span> For the current re-design of this site, in conversation with Dr. Gillespie, it became clear that we were both working from slightly different resources. The folio edition of the <cite>Rotuli litterarum patentium in Turri londinensi asservati</cite> was published in 1835 by Eyre and Spottiswoode. Hardy's Itinerary was included with his introduction to this volume ( <a target="_blank" class="text-link external" href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38630269">folio ed</a> ). However, also in 1835 Hardy's introduction and itinerary appeared in a separate quarto volume <cite>A Description of the Patent Rolls in the Tower of London; to which is added an Itinerary of King John with preferatory observations. </cite>( <a target="_blank" class="text-link external" href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/895817071">quarto ed</a> )</p>
						
						<p>In the main, this site treats the folio edition of the <cite>Rot. Lit. Pat.</cite> as canonical, and the page scans included under the "Page Images" tab above come from that edition. However, I had presumed that the quarto edition was identical. It is not. The number of discrepancies that exist between the two publications is remarkably small, but potentially significant. Dr. Gillespie has carefully catalogued these discrepancies in a <a target="_blank" class="text-link external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQcxpk9T6H8FmgR617K-Zu9QYF-V5GVkFcPIQlLBM5gR25SHibCXx8CdGg56k84DqZjJOxjj4_Q-agO/pubhtml">summary table</a>. Moreover, where possible, an indication that a discrepancy exists will be provided in the relevant timeline bubble and in the corresponding geographical data.</p>
						
						<p>To complicate the bibliographical picture still further, Hardy, in 1827, presented a preliminary version of the same itinerary which was then published in 1835.  In this paper there are additional indications of note. "In the following Table I have endeavoured to give the modern designation where I was satisfied of the identity of the place. A royal Manor or demesne is marked by an asterisk *; a Castle in the King's hands by a dagger &#8224;; a Religious house by &#8225;." No attempt has been made here to collate this earlier table with the 1835 version presented here. If you encounter interesting discrepancies or additional data in the earlier version, contact me and we can add a note in the relevant records. The 1827 version appears in: the Society of Antiquaries of London. <u>Archaeologia, Or, Miscellaneous Tracts Relating to Antiquity</u>. London: The Society, 1770, vol.XXII, pg.124 (1829). This work, along with the two 1835 publications are made available by the HathiTrust and have been gathered in a collection here: <a class="text-link external" target="_blank" href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?a=listis&c=799372342">Itinerary of John</a>.</p>

					<dt>The Map</dt>
					<dd>
						Place-names have always been a problem for students of medieval records. Places change their names; the same place-name is sometimes applied to more than one location; places, once important, sometimes disappear altogether and are known only by their names in the records.
						
						<p>The place markers on the map were initially derived by querying the Google geocoding interface using Hardy's place-names. This was a pretty crude first pass at providing geographical data for the timeline events. The procedure resulted in many errors since Google knows nothing of medieval places. Fortunately, as a result of the generous contribution of Janet Gillespie (see "Construction Zone" above), detailed and accurate coordinates, as well as other supporting geographic information have now been supplied. The map markers now reflect these coordinates, and clicking on any of the map markers will open a dialog containing the current data for that place.</p>
						
						<p>In his 1835 publications, Hardy identified 641 distinct places that John visited. Of these, a few actually refer to more than one place, so the total number of places currently in our gazetteer is 655. Where Hardy's original placename refers to multiple locations, that fact has been noted in the timeline bubble.</p>

					<dt>Band One</dt>
					<dd>
					The first band in the time-line displays events of significance for the reign of King John and for medieval European history generally. Clicking on any of the events will display a bubble containing descriptive or explanatory text, and links to further relevant information. The lighter highlight in the middle of this band represents the span of time showing in band three.<br /></dd>
					
					<dt>Band Two</dt>
					<dd>
					The second band is a schematic representation only of the data displayed in detail in band three so that you can see at a glance the periods of greater activity. The vertical ticks represent point dates, and the horizontal ticks represent durations. The time scale for this band is the same as for the one above, but it is marked with the regnal years of King John.  John was crowned on Ascension day in 1199. Ascension is a moveable feast and so John's regnal year begins and ends on a different day each year. This is indicated in the scale at the top, and with a label at the beginning of each regnal year in band 3. My thanks to David Huynh, the principal author of the timeline software, for working out the code to represent this irregular schedule. <br /></dd>
					
					<dt>Band Three</dt>
					<dd>
					The third band displays the elements of John's Itinerary as they appeared in the introduction to the Patent Rolls. Unless you have a research university handy, consulting the patent rolls can be a problem. Hardy's itinerary, published in 1835, is invaluable, but not the sort of thing that you can pick up at your local used book store. In unwieldy folio volumes, the itinerary was published as a series of tables appended to Hardy's introduction. This format was not ideal. An internet browser now makes it possible to display this data in a more graphically intelligible format. Clicking on these events will cause the corresponding map marker to bounce in order to identify it. Also, a bubble will be displayed that contains a link to the pages of the Rot.Lit.Pat. that contain letters dated for that date. The bubble also contains a button that will display the available geographic information for the referenced place. The itinerary is thus a useful gazetteer to many of the geographical locations of importance in early thirteenth-century European history. I have used the place-names exactly as they appear in Hardy.<br /></dd>
