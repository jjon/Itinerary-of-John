It may also have marked the completion of the great stone bridge across the Trent. The discovery in 1201 of alleged relics of St. Modwen presumably encouraged pilgrims to visit the abbey church and so may also have helped to develop the town's economy\"",

            "\"During the whole reign of King John, Exeter, with its governor, Robert de Courtenay, continued loyal to that monarch. In 1216 he had the King's licence to take in William de Brewer and his forces, if he thought his own, with the aid of the citizens, insufficient to defend the city. Although it does not appear that he had shown any symptoms of disloyalty to his successor, yet the jealousy of the times deeming it improper that so important a fortress should be in the hands of a subject, the custody of the castle and city of Exeter, which had so long been hereditary in his family, was taken from Robert de Courtenay, and given to Peter de Rivaux.\"",

Noted in time of Henry II and before- probably dating back to Saxon times; called the \"Fraternity of St Nicolas\" since the 9th century.  John started the 4 March 1212 here before moving on to St Brides. Easter was 25 March 1212 so was this a Lent play? ( it wasn't St Nicolas' feast day which is in Dec)",

There would have been no reason to beseige Montauban given its ally status, although a letter from John to the people of Agen suggests that he considered the Count to be hostile (22 Jan 1203) but this might be another example of the suspicion he held at this time which \" the fidelity of none, from the earl of Chester downwards, was untouched\"  Destination therefore taken to be as per Hardy"

It was built in 1207 at a recorded cost of less than \u00a350  by the king's carpenters.  As the work was supervised by Hugh de Neville, the king's chief forester, and the house lay within easy reach of the forests of Bernwood and Whittlewood, there can be little doubt that it was constructed as a hunting-lodge. It was ready by January 1208, when the king ordered wine to be sent there. He subsequently stayed in it four times. The overlordship of the manor was in the king's hands at the time, and the house was built on land belonging to a hermit, who had a hermitage there. As compensation he was assigned a penny a day for life. After the king's death, however, he recovered his property, and in 1218 it was described as 'the place where the house of King John was situated\""

It stood on the east bank of the Avon below the Moot, from which it was later cut off by a mill-stream. It was used regularly by bishops and visited by kings. As a result of several visits by King John local tradition gave it the name 'King John's Palace'. Bishops were still living at Downton in the later 14th century,\""

De Verdun died on the 3rd Crusade in 1192. The town is now known as Dundalk and in Irish, Dundalk Bay is called Cuan Dh\u00fan Dealgan  - perhaps explaning the phonetic contraction Cadelac.  Dundalk therefore has been taken as the destination."

Its ruins on the Mound of Down measure 895yds diameter. Repeated excavations suggest that the foundations may date to the first century but there was a 13th century Norman mote and bailey construction on top. Until the River Quoil water barrier was constructed in 1957, the area was tidal and often made the mound into an island. Evidence of raised causeways is still visible in the surrounding marshes and so it is likely that John arrived by boat from Ardglass.",

However KJ remained in Deux Sevres until 19 July with the exception of 6 days (9-14th) so either the pillaging  was shorter than two weeks or deferred to period 25 July to 22 Aug when KJ went south.
